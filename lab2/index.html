			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<p>Hello world! My name is Trinity, and for this lab, I am working with Ireland! Ireland is a second year EJD and General Psychology double major, who enjoys yoga, coloring, and trying new coffee with friends. As for me, I am from San Francisco, and I am part of Asian American Christian Fellowship and a K-pop dance team called Starchrome. Ireland and I met through ART 101 section and have been partners for these first two labs. It has been such a joy getting to know her and work on these labs together, and I am glad I can help with my past coding experience.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to apply what we learned in class to create our very own HTML and CSS files.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>While I did not have any problems in terms of coding, I was confused about the instructions for this assignment, as the example on Canvas displayed something different. The example on Canvas showed a screenshot of an HTML page that had not yet been linked to a CSS file, but the index.html that we were provided with was already linked to CSS files.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment went well after clearing up the confusion about the Canvas example and the instructions. I enjoyed using what we learned in class about HTML and CSS to create our first web page. I also had a lot of fun playing with the CSS file and finding different fonts and colors.</p>
