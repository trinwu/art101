			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to introduce pseudocoding, which is often used before actual coding takes place.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There were no problems that I encountered during this lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Pseudocoding is something I was already familiar with, as I have practiced it in my previous coding classes. However, this lab still served as a good reminder about why it is a good habit to use pseudocode before you actually begin coding. It helped me to think about how to break down tasks into high-level tasks and further breaking those into sub-tasks.</p>

								<h4>Pseudocode for Making Banana Bread</h4>
								<p>1. Gather Ingredients and supplies
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;1.1. Measure out:
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2 to 3 ripe bananas
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1/3 cup melted butter
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1 teaspoon baking soda
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Pinch of salt
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3/4 cup sugar (adjust to taste)
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1 large egg, beaten
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1 teaspoon vanilla extract
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;1.2 Get a loaf pan, a spatula, a fork, and a mixing bowl
									<br>2. Preheat the Oven
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;2.1. Set the oven to 350Â°F to preheat.
									<br>3. Prepare the Baking Pan
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;3.1. Grease a 4x8-inch loaf pan with butter or nonstick spray.
									<br>4. Mash the Bananas
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;4.1. Peel the ripe bananas. 
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;4.2. Place them in a large mixing bowl. 
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;4.3. Mash the bananas using a fork until smooth.
									<br>5. Mix Wet Ingredients
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;5.1. Add the melted butter to the mashed bananas.
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;5.2. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract until combined.
									<br>6. Add Dry Ingredients
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;6.1. Sprinkle the baking soda and a pinch of salt over the wet mixture.
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;6.2. Stir in the flour gradually until all ingredients are fully combined.
									<br>7. Pour the Batter into the Pan
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;7.1. Pour the banana bread batter into the greased loaf pan. 
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;7.2. Smooth the top of the batter with a spatula if necessary.
									<br>8. Bake the Banana Bread
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;8.1. Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven. 
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;8.2. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
									<br>9. Cool the Bread
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;9.1. Once the bread is done, remove it from the oven. 
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;9.2. Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes. 
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;9.3. Transfer the bread to a wire rack to cool completely.
									<br>10. Serve and Enjoy
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;10.1. Once the bread has cooled, slice and serve. 
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;10.2. Optionally, spread butter or honey on each slice.

								<h4>Pseudocode for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game</h4>
								<p>1. Set Up the Game Environment
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;1.1. Display the game title and instructions. 
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;1.2. Provide options for the player to choose between "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors." 
									<br>2. Handle Player Input
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;2.1. Wait for the player to select one of the options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). 
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;2.2. Validate the player's input. 
									<br>3. Generate the Computer's Choice
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;3.1. Use a random number generator to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors for the computer.
									<br>4. Compare Player and Computer Choices
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;4.1. Determine the outcome based on the following rules:
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Rock beats Scissors.
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Scissors beats Paper.
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Paper beats Rock.
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Identical choices result in a tie.
									<br>5. Display the Result
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;5.1. Show the player's choice and the computer's choice. 
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;5.2. Announce the outcome (Win, Loss, or Tie). 
									<br>6. Ask the Player if They Want to Play Again
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;6.1. Provide an option for the player to:
									<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Play another round.
