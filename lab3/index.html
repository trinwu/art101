			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab, the goal was to create a local file structure on my computer, add index.html files to it, and upload it the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I did not have any problems with file structure or adding index.html files, as I was already familiar with it through my experience from other coding classes. However, I would sometimes forget how to access a file from another folder, but I just searched for examples to help me. I struggled a bit with creating columns within a row for my introduction, portrait, and about me blurb, but I searched up tutorials and examples to assist me. I also thought I had trouble uploading to GitHub, but I realized that it just took sometime for the GitHub page to update to match the changes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was a good reminder about why file structure is important, as it makes finding files much easier. This lab also served as good practice for accessing files from other folders. I put a lot of effort into making my homepage fit the aesthetic that I envisioned for it. I spent a lot of time searching up many examples so that I could try doing more advanced things through CSS, such as making boxes and making them light up when hovered over.</p>
